This library contains implementations of data structures and algorithms for geometry and mesh processing.
Other things that could be implemented here are curves and surface methods such as subdivision surfaces.

# Dependencies
[Eigen3 (C++ header-only linear algebra library)](https://gitlab.com/libeigen/eigen)
