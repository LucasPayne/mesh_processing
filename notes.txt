Types of topology.
Closed manifold.
Manifold with boundary. Boundary is a boolean function of edges.
Manifoldness tests, verify if has the right topology (will need to do after non-Euler editing).

Euler operations.
Maintain manifoldness. Might have to check when editing boundary.


Halfedge attachment.
By default implement chains and oriented faces.
This will make construction of meshes easier, and finding the boundary will just consist of finding
half-edges which don't have an opposite.
